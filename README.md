The app uses the following libraries:

### `axios`
Used to handle api connections in a easy way.

### `react-fontawesome`
Some FontAwesome icons were added to give the layout a better look.
   
### `react-router-dom`
Used to handle routes inside the web app.

## Build Instructions
There are no special needs here. You just need to run `npm run build` or `yarn run build`.
